        <h2 class="aboutme">A bit about me...</h2>
        <p>I'm Camila M. Tamayo, a web developer with over 5 years of experience in partnering with different business to bring their vision to the screens of every visitor that comes through their website.
        </p>
        <p>With multiple customers world-wide, I am able to adapt to whatever needs your brand will have, making sure to heavily prioritize the longevity of the project we create. My goal is to always ensure my clients have full access to the code and the information needed to make common changes to the site. This, is with the intention of you keeping your independence and having the freedom to choose who maintains your project, as well as how.</p>
        <p>I stand by my clients by offering unparalleled customer service, because your satisfaction matters. I plan to achieve this, by offering a 30-day support period to help your content integrate well with the template we choose to implement. You don't have to worry about hitting a snag.</p>
